Snake Game - Nokia Nostalgia
This project is a classic Snake game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, inspired by the iconic Nokia mobile game. The game offers smooth, responsive controls and audio feedback for a nostalgic user experience. Here's a breakdown of the tech stack:

HTML: Structures the game layout, including the score and control buttons.

CSS: Styles the game board, snake, food, and controls using flexbox, grid, and gradients for a visually appealing interface.

JavaScript: Manages game logic, collision detection, snake movement, food generation, and scoring. It uses the requestAnimationFrame method for smooth gameplay, along with event listeners for player input.

Audio: Includes sound effects for movement, food collection, and game-over events.

LocalStorage: Stores and displays the high score persistently.

This project is optimized for both desktop and mobile gameplay with a custom touch interface for easy controls.
